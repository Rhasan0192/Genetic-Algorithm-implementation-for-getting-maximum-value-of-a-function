# Genetic-Algorithm-implementation-for-getting-maximum-value-of-a-function

Problem statement :
The idea of the project is to design three version of GA to find a solution that maximizes the function
subject to constraints
Solution Approach:
f(x1, x2) = 21.5 + x1 * sin(4πx1) + x2 * sin(20πx2)
-12.0≤x1 ≤12.0and-6.0≤x2≤6.0
Solution has three version. Version -1 has followed only basic steps of GA algorithm design , version-2 has been improved by adding tuning parameter of mutational probability, version-3 has been designed to get more diversification and oversized uniform selection method has been used. Every version follows the general EA scheme. Each version has been run for 10 iteration using initial population size of 1000 and for 30 generation.
